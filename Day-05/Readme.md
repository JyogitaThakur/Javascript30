## Day-05 : Flexbox + JavaScript Image Gallery

In this Exercise, you make a photo gallery page where each image is shown and clicking on an image will expand it to take up more space to get a better look. With the expanding image, some text also animates in from the top and bottom giving a nice, smooth feel to the whole thing.
