## Day-19 -  Webcam Fun

In this Exercise, we are playing around with the webcam for a photo booth and doing cool effects by manipulating the RGB channels. 

## Steps:

- First of all, we have to get our video being piped in from our webcam, and then we've got our video being piped into a canvas element. 
- Then, once it's in a canvas element, we can start to do all kinds of cool things with it. Like we can take our photo, and then you can go ahead and download them. They'll download to our
computer, and you can see them as real photos. 
- Then, in the scripts, once we have it, we can start to add effects, like different filters where things should be red.
