## Day-17 -  Sort Without Articles

In this Exercise, we learned about the sort method, where we are going to sort the Band Name without "The, A, An " in front of the actual band names beacuse those are articles and they don't go into alphabetizing the actual name of the band.
We will display the sorted names on the webpage along with the "A", "An" and "The", just that they won't be affecting the sort order.
